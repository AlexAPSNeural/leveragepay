Creating an environment variables template is crucial for configuring your application's runtime environment. Below is a generic example of how such a template might look. This template provides a structure for defining environment variables for different application aspects such as database configuration, API keys, and security settings.

```plaintext
# Environment Variables Template

# Application Environment
# Options: development, production, testing
NODE_ENV=development

# Application Port
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=myapp
DB_USER=myappuser
DB_PASSWORD=secretpassword

# JWT Secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# API Keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key

# Email Server
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=noreply@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=emailpassword

# Logging Level
# Options: error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Redis Configuration (if applicable)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=redispassword

# Custom Variables
CUSTOM_VARIABLE=some_value

# Flag for enabling/disabling features
FEATURE_X_ENABLED=true

# CORS Whitelist
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# Third-party Service Configurations
SERVICE_X_API_KEY=service_x_api_key
SERVICE_Y_API_KEY=service_y_api_key
```

### Important Notes:

1. **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, and secret keys) is kept secure. For production, consider using services like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar to manage secrets securely.

2. **Comments**: Use comments to describe what each variable is used for. This helps in understanding and managing the configuration.

3. **Different Environments**: You may want to have different `.env` files for different environments (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`).

4. **Version Control**: Never commit your `.env` file with actual sensitive data to version control systems. Instead, provide a `.env.example` or `env.template` file with placeholder values.

5. **Consistency**: Ensure the variable naming is consistent and descriptive.

Make sure to customize the template based on the specific needs and configurations of your application.
